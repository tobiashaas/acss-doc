The entire Automatic.css system is easily installed and configured with the Automatic.css plugin.

1. Download the plugin to your computer  
2. Login to your WordPress dashboard  
3. Navigate to Plugins > Add New  
4. Click the "Upload" button at the top  
5. Click the "Choose File" button  
6. Select the plugin file on your computer  
7. Click the button to activate the plugin  

Once the plugin is installed and activated you'll see a new Automatic.css area in the left admin sidebar in your WordPress dashboard.

Open the License part of the dashboard and put in your license key and you're ready to start using Automatic.css.

> **Note:** There may be two keys in your [account dashboard](/account). Use the key named "--Automatic.css" â€“ don't use the bundle key or the key with the name of the license plan you purchased. The one you want is usually second in the list.

## Important

**While there are a ton of adjustable settings in Automatic and the plugin dashboard may feel overwhelming to some ... the framework requires practically no setup to function properly.**
